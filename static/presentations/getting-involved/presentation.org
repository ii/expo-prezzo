#+TITLE:  Getting Involved

* Find your Community
No matter which open source community calls to you, we've found the following
steps can help you become an active member.
* Join their chat and say hi
Most communities have a common chat channel: an email list, discord, slack, etc.
Join and say hi!
* Look for "Good First Issues"
Thesee are simple improvements the community wants, but hasn't the time to accomplish.
They are often explicitly labelled, and a great first step.
* Look for ways to create or improve docs
This is always appreciated and you can never have enough documentation.
* Follow their contributing guide
These guides explain how the community wishes to work together.
Respecting them shows respect to the larger community.
* Share and ask questions!
The best community is an active, chatty one. Being yourself, where you're at, is
the best contribution.
* Join a local meetup
ii often hosts hangouts for open source enthusiasts.  Come and say hi!

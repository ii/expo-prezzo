#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in

#+begin_notes
Everyone in this room has used software from the these Foundations.

My mentor Dan Kohn, created the Open Heath Foundation to help public health authorities use open source software to fight COVID-19. He helped coordinate Google and Apple to create the exposure framework used by most of the world. I'm proud to say that code is used within New Zealand's COVID tracing app, which is also open source.

Earlier this year, they worked with the US Government to help create an Open Programmable and Secure 5G End to End stack.

There is too much loss of productivity and innovation due to the absence of re-usable tools and data.

I think New Zealand is well placed to go further, together by curating local talent connected to the global ecosystem of innovation.

It's the reason I've spent the last 10 years of my life in New Zealand.

Our youth are the future, and will be working for council within ten years.

- Tauranga Teens :: speaking overseas on cloud infrastructure
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
- Cloud Native :: from an early age
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
- Beyond Us Impact :: servant leaders of tomorrow
#+begin_notes
I'm most proud of my success mentoring and teaching local youth to be leaders and engage directly with the IT communities in which we serve.

Many of them traveling or speaking internationally on advanced research topics as teenagers.


Our youth today are inherently 'cloud native' from an early age, and the desire for 'beyond us' impact and engament might surprise us if we give them a chance.

If we are going to have council employees in the next ten years that can onboard our community to these resources, we need to start now.

If our students can be on-ramped to active participation in the open source culture of inclusion, transparency, and governance, they will be well prepared to lead these types of initiatives locally.

  The call to action is simple here:
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
What Software does Council currently use?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
Can Open Source be an explicit part of the conversation?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
Can I be invited to those conversations?
#+begin_notes
I know we are all honored to have input into this ten year community collaboration plan.

I'd like to point to some positive change

Some of us will be experts in finance, others in physical infrastructure, mine is in the could.

#+TITLE:  What is Open Source?

* Open Source Technology
Open source refers to creative work--often software--that is free to use, copy,
remix, and modify.
* Open Source Creation
It is also a method of collaboration, where creative work is done in the open,
and everyone is invited to contribute and share.
* Free to use, remix, share, and evolve
With open source, not only do you have more tools at your disposal, but you can
personalize and improve these tools, then share them with whoever you please!
* We think this is incredibly cool.
* A career in free stuff?
When everyone can contribute, a project is able to improve in ways the original
creators could only imagine.
* A career in free stuff?
This tends to create exciting, resilient, popular, and adaptable work-- work
that businesses and other institutions want to fund.
* Is it only software?
The term Open Source originated with software, but it is not limited to it. You
can find exmaples of open source in art, design, construction, cuisine,
goverment and law, music, and more.
* Is open source right for you?
Probably! No matter your aptitude or interests, there is likely an open source
project that you will love,and that would love to have you!
* The End
Thanks! Come chat with us at the booth if you have any questions!
